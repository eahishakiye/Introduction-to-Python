#Python is extremely moduler and is object oriented
#A module is a piece code that does some function (to achieve some functionality)
# Modules help to create packages which perform some activity
# we want to prepare and structure our code so that it can be reused
# Start calling a folder but a directory
# A file in python is called a script
# A folder (directory) that contains a script(s), and if the script is used as a python function, the package becomes a package and the #script is a module
