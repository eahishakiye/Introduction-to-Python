# Python is extremely moduler and is object oriented
# A module is a piece code that does some function (to achieve some functionality)
# Modules help to create packages which perform some activity
# we want to prepare and structure our code so that it can be reused
# Start calling a folder but a directory
# A file in python is called a script
# A folder (directory) that contains a script(s), and if the script is used as a python function, the package becomes a package and the #script is a module
# OOP is a paradigm of software development based on real world objects
# Classes vs objects
# OOP principles
# 1. Polymorphism
# 2. Inheritance
# 3. Abstraction
# 4. Encapsulation
# A class is a blueprint of an object
# A blue print is an original copy of something e.g. Emma is a blue print of a man.
# An individual created from the blueprint is an object
# An Object is an instance of a class
# These objects have things in common from the master print (the class)
# Ahishakiye (object)is an instance of a person (class)
# A class gives an existence of object
# we create variables of class (properties) and we give full meaning to have an object

# Attributes of animal
# Should have name, legs, color. Any animal should have those properties
# if you want to understand a class of an object we use "is a"
# A cat is an object and animal is a class

# Abstraction, you hide some details that may not be necessary
# E.g museveni is a dad, and therefore while at home we handles family business as a father and husband.
# some information is private like age, number of body counts 

# inheritance. You have a concept of a parent and child
# Toyota is a child of a car
# Techno is a child of a smart phone
# Inheritance is the ability by an object to take on attributes from different classes
# Eg Toyota wish belongs to toyota class and Car class

# Polymorphism is the ability to take different forms
# Eg Museveni is a pres1dent, a father, a soldier, a grand father

# Encapsulation
# Ability to have what to share and what not to share
# Public, protected and private

# Write two dynamic functions. The first function that prompts a user to input name, age, email, gender and it prints them out
# Second function should prompt the user to input paye (30%), nssf (11%), gross and then it calculates net pay
