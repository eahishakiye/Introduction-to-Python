#A named block of code is called a function
# The code should be related to perform a certain function
#Functions are the building blocks for programming languages
#Example
def myfunction():
    num1, num2 = 20, 40
    print(num1 + num2)

#function call    
myfunction()

# There are two types of functions, static and dynamic functions
# The function above is static because it has hardcoded values i.e. values that does not change when the function is running
